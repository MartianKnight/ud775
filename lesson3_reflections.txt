1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you use multiple devices to code on. This could also imply there are multiple users of your code too.


2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might have commits that you haven't pushed or merged into github. It is better to push or merge and then pull if needed.


3) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are for cloning repos on github with a reference to the orginal. Clones are for grabbing repos from remote repo and making a copy with no reference to the orginal. Branches are splits in the commit history.


4) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

This allows you to merge at a later time if needed. You can also view the state of your files and the remote with diff.
